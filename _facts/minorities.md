Mike Bloomberg understands that crime is a problem exclusive to minorities, that's why he supports an initiative to just xerox descriptions of non-white males ages 16-25 and list that as the default suspect on all crimes. This bold strategy will save police precious minutes in hunting down the suspects of crimes, making the entire police force more efficient.
