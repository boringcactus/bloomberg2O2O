Mayor Bloomberg is committed to reducing crime, that's why he dedicated his time as mayor of New York City to turning it into a police state! Through Mike's work on Stop and Frisk millions of citizens of New York City, 90% of whom were minorities, were stopped during their day to be put against a wall and felt up by police officers! This forwarding thinking strategy of treating millions of people as criminals without any probable cause has become a landmark of Mike Bloomberg's time as Mayor.
