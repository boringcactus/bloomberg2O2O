Mike Bloomberg is a pro-choice candidate! Upon hearing one of his employees was pregnant, mike advised her to "Kill it", a bold entrance into the heated political topic that is abortion.

Mayor Bloomberg also understands that "Cancel Culture" has gone too far. Dozens of women have tried to cancel Mike, however he has nimbly navigated these accusations, using his business acumen to buy their silence. Under Mike Bloomberg you can expect a cultral shift away from having your job threatened by "broads" who "didn't like a joke you told". Mike understands that women just don't have a sense of humor about these things. He hopes to move back to normallacy, where you can make comments asking your employees about their blowjob skills, or joking with your boys about how much you want to bang your secretary. This farcical pastime has been an American institution for decades, so why are these Communists trying to take it away?
